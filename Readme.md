# UltraDesign

UltraDesign was a commerical 2D CAD system that I wrote in the late 80s for the Amiga in C for a company called WurbSoft (which I owned).

It worked well with plotters and other similar devices.

It had a commercial license back in the day.  I haven't decided what license I want to have it under -- but something open.
