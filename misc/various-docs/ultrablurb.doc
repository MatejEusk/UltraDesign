UltraCAD - A high-end general-purpose CAD system for the Commodore AMIGA

A very user-friendly package for the creation of high quality artwork on many commonly available plotters, laser and dot matrix printers.

Drawing objects can be grouped by different attributes, the number of which is limited only by memory.  All attributes can have names of up to 30 characters.  Attributes allow users to organize their drawings  and provide flexible mechanisms for manipulating,  updating and storing drawing elements.  Attributes  types include:

   Lettering Styles - Used to specifying sizing, slant, aspect,
        and font type for on different classes of text.
        Text sizes can be scaled to the drawing scale or to
        the output sheet size. 

   Layers - For the segregation of items by subject.

   Groups - Groups allow objects to be organized hierarchically
        by assembly or class.  Any level of the drawing can be
        designated as the beginning of a drawing assembly.

   Pen Style - Used to determine the appearance of display and
        plotted lines.  This data is also used by the plotting
        program to specify how the output will appear.

UltraCAD has a powerful editing tool called the Clipboard.  Drawing elements can be placed in the clipboard, and then can be deleted, moved, copied, rotated, scaled, flipped and stretched.  Items in the clipboard can also be moved quickly from one attribute type to another, allowing the drawing organization to be changed rapidly.  Clipboards can also be saved to disk, and merged into the current drawing from disk.

Text can be positioned anywhere in the drawing, and its appearance is controlled by its lettering style attribute.  The style allows the user to utilize standardized drafting procedures which call for lettering to be drawn in given sizes and arrangements.  Different font styles are available.  These range from simple drawing fonts to complex multiple stroke fonts which enhance the appearance of any drawing and give them a truly professional touch.

Drawing size units can be converted automatically back and forth from metric to English units for both lengths and angles.   These include standard English architectural units as well as engineering English and metric units.

Often-used drawing elements can be assembled into template libraries, which  can then be inserted into new drawings as they are composed.  Libraries can be used to reduce effort, and can be used to standardize your drafting  procedures as well.  Canned standard libraries and additional fonts  will soon be available as separate product offerings.

The zoom and pan features allow the user to view the drawing at whatever detail level is desired, and, in a task such as drawing a picture of the Earth to scale, allows the drawing to be executed in strokes ranging from the huge to the most microscopic.

Items on the screen can be colored by their attribute types.  Objects can be colored by layer, group, or pen.  This can be switched back and forth and can offer useful presentation possibilities.  Items can also be ghosted (displayed with a dim gray dotted line), or can be turned off altogether if desired.  This allows comments, registration lines, or multiple option drawings (such as metric/English, or multi-language) to be created and maintained.  This also allows parts of the drawing which are not currently being maintained to be turned off, thus reducing clutter or redraw time.  Items can also be turned on or off on the plotter for the  same effect.  Layers, Groups, and Pen Styles can also be locked so that no accidental changes can be made to finished drawing segments.
